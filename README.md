Cover page has a separate nav bar, apply the Cover Page template to the relevant page.

Showcase has three pages at the top - define custom fields: "showcase-summary" with
a quick summary of the post to be displayed. Also, "showcase-image" will be used as the
url to the image.

Customise the footer from theme customisation. There's a nav bar there too.

Blockquotes need to be structured like this:

    <blockquote>
        <p>I say something important!</p>
        <footer><cite>Somebody</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
